# .gitattributes Configuration

This `.gitattributes` file is designed to customize how GitHub handles and displays various file types in this repository. Here's a breakdown of what each line does:

## Documentation and Language Specifications

- **Markdown Files**:
  ```plaintext
  *.md linguist-documentation=Markdown
  ```
  - Treats `.md` files as documentation, ensuring they don't skew the repository's language statistics.

- **Mermaid Diagrams**:
  ```plaintext
  *.mmd linguist-language=Mermaid
  ```
  - Sets `.mmd` files to be recognized as Mermaid diagrams for correct syntax highlighting.

## Code Syntax Highlighting

- **Python**:
  ```plaintext
  *.py linguist-language=Python
  ```
  - Ensures Python files are correctly highlighted.

- **Dockerfile**:
  ```plaintext
  Dockerfile linguist-language=Dockerfile
  ```
  - Explicitly sets Dockerfiles for proper syntax highlighting.

- **Ansible**:
  ```plaintext
  *.ini linguist-language=Ansible
  *.ini-eg linguist-language=Ansible
  *.yml linguist-language=Ansible
  *.yml-eg linguist-language=Ansible
  *.yaml linguist-language=Ansible
  ```
  - Configures various file extensions used by Ansible for correct highlighting.

- **HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language)**:
  ```plaintext
  *.hcl linguist-language=HCL
  *.tf linguist-language=HCL
  *.tfvars linguist-language=HCL
  ```
  - Sets HCL files (including Terraform configurations) to be recognized as HCL.

- **Shell Scripts**:
  ```plaintext
  *.sh linguist-language=Shell
  ```
  - Sets `.sh` files to be highlighted as Shell scripts.

### Why Use `.gitattributes`?

- **Syntax Highlighting**: Ensures that files are displayed with the correct syntax highlighting on GitHub, which is crucial for readability and understanding the code.
- **Language Detection**: Helps GitHub's Linguist tool in correctly identifying the primary language of the repository, especially useful in multi-language projects.
- **Customization**: Allows for fine-tuning how GitHub interprets and displays your files, which can be particularly useful for projects with custom or ambiguous file extensions.

### How to Use:

1. **Create or Edit `.gitattributes`**: Add the above lines to your `.gitattributes` file in the root of your repository.
2. **Commit and Push**: Commit this file and push it to your repository on GitHub.
3. **Wait for Update**: GitHub will update the file views and language statistics based on these settings.

By using this `.gitattributes` file, you ensure that your repository's files are displayed with the correct syntax highlighting, which enhances the user experience for anyone viewing or contributing to your project. This setup is particularly useful for repositories that use multiple languages or have specific needs for file type recognition.
